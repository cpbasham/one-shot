OneShot<br>
This is the mvp of my app.<br>
You can find it running at: <a href="https://quiet-castle-7283.herokuapp.com/">https://quiet-castle-7283.herokuapp.com/</a><br>
<br>
It's a very simple app.  Currently its only purpose is to create an item set and to subsequently generate the corresponding JSON file.<br>
My plan is to also allow users to log in and save/reload/share their item sets, but that will have to happen after the API challenge is over.<br>
<br>
USAGE<br>
-----<br>
Select the map and game type you want to target in the dropdown menus.<br>
Name your set.<br>
Create new rows and name them as well.<br>
Search for items on the left, then drag them into the rows you want them in.<br>
To delete an item, double-click it.
To delete a row, click inside it to show the red/white "X" button.  Then double click it.<br>
Once you have your set the way you want it, click the "Generate Link!" button and you should instantly see your new download link.  (Don't be afraid to make some changes and regenerate if need be).<br>
Click the download button and voila, the JSON file corresponding to your set should be downloaded.<br>
Be sure to pop it in the correct "recommended" folder inside of your League config files.
